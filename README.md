## Custom Analytics

- This simple plugin will allowed you to print out how many people has visited to your website by using shortcode called `[sm_tracking]`.
- The tracking mechanism is using Cookies. It will store for 999 years. So if you wanted to store it for your desire numbers, you are free to change that manually. For now, I will keep it to 999 (or forever?)
